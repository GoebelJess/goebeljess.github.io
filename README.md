      <strong>Hello!</strong> I’m Jess and I’m a third-year PhD student at NYU. I am a Sociolinguist who is interested in bilingualism, particularly in the German-English context. More about my research interests:

### Bilingualism
My research examines linguistic variation among multilingual speakers using sociolinguistic and psycholinguistic methods. I am interested the social and cognitive factors that affect language variability. During my Master’s degree at Queen Mary University of London, I investigated how cognitive load (or divided attention) affects bilingual style shifting and style control, under the supervision of [Dr Kathleen McCarthy](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/sllf/linguistics/people/academic/profiles/mccarthy.html). 

### Social class

Another one of my interests lies in analysing social class effects on linguistic variation. My undergraduate dissertation at the University of Edinburgh examines how socially mobile speakers (individuals who had been upwardly socially mobile in their life) pattern differently from speakers whose social class had remained static. I was supervised by [Prof Lauren Hall-Lew](https://www.laurenhall-lew.com/). This research made me interested in improving operationalizations of socioeconomic status by treating social class as potentially fluid.
