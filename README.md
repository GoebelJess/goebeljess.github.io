# Jess Göbel

Hello! I’m Jess and I’m a first year PhD student at NYU. I am interested in bilingualism, especially in the German-English context. My research examines linguistic variation among multilingual speakers using sociolinguistic and psycholinguistic methods – I am interested in the social and cognitive factors that affect language variability. During my Master’s degree at Queen Mary University of London, I investigated how cognitive load (or divided attention) affects bilingual style-shifting and style control.

Another one of my interests lies in examining social class effects on linguistic variation. My undergraduate dissertation examines how socially mobile speakers (individuals who had been upwardly socially mobile in their life) pattern differently from speakers whose social class had remained static.
